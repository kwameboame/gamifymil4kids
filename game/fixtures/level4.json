When I am not busy, I love watching music videos of my favorite musicians, playing video games and sometimes hanging out with friends after school. I love providing updates on my class What's App page but one day, something strange happened, one post I shared caused a big confusion in class. That was when I started learning that not everything we see online is okay to share. Some things can hurt others, spread lies, or even get us in trouble! So come with me on this exciting journey as I learn how to think before I click, ask questions before I post, and become a super smart sharer online! Let's find out together what it really means to be kind, safe, and honest on the internet.",
